1- When i switch tabs between email and phone number in login, i want the inputs to fadeIn and fadeOut. Check the component i left notes on how to do it
2- Instead of creating a text called forgot password, the input has a prop called subText. Check it out and create a similar prop for the phone input
3- In the verify screen, when the code hits 6 digits it should automatically initiate verify code. Simulate it for now
4- There is something wrong in the phone input inside the sign-up page
5- Please never import components from their index file. Always import them from the folder index file. This way our components file path will always remain the same as we exchange components
