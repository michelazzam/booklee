1- Replace the touchable opacity buttons in the onboarding screen with the custom button we have
2- When i switch tabs between email and phone number in login, i want the inputs to fadeIn and fadeOut. Check the component i left notes on how to do it
3- Add more gap between the inputs in the login page
4- Instead of creating a text called forgot password, the input has a prop called subText. Check it out and create a similar prop for the phone input
5- Go into the app layout and change the status bar color from auto to dark
6- In the verify screen, when the code hits 6 digits it should automatically initiate verify code. Simulate it for now
7- There is something wrong in the phone input inside the sign-up page
8- The onboarding layout is overkill just use the same layout as the one i used inside the unauthenticated layout. Check it out
9- Move the forgot-password folder inside the login folder, since realistically u can only access forgot password through login screen. So it makes more sense. What do u think?
10- Capitalize the word Booklee in the onboarding screen
11- Please never import components from their index file. Always import them from the folder index file. This way our components file path will always remain the same as we exchange components
